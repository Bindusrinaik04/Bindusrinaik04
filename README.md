I hold a Master of Technology (M.Tech) in Information Technology from the School of Computer and Information Sciences, University of Hyderabad, and a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and Engineering from MGIT, Hyderabad (2022).
With a strong academic foundation and a passion for real-world problem solving, I have built a diverse skill set in data analysis, Python programming, SQL, data visualization (Tableau). My work spans end-to-end data projects, from data cleaning and transformation to building interactive dashboards.
I am driven by continuous learning and hands-on practice. My GitHub portfolio showcases a range of self-initiated projects, reflecting my ability to apply theory to practical use cases and my enthusiasm for collaborating on impactful, data-centric solutions.
I’m particularly focused on data analytics and engineering roles where I can contribute to building scalable, meaningful solutions. I am actively seeking opportunities that challenge me intellectually and help me grow within a collaborative, innovative environment.
